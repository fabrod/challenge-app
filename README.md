# Challenge

Create an API that contains a single endpoint:
* LoadUrl(string url) â€“ when called, the api should download the content of the url. It should return a list of all images, a count of all words, and a count of each word within the content.

Create a website that allows the user to input a url. When submitted, the site should call the previously created API. Once a response is received, the site should display the following things:
* A carousel of images
* A total word count
* A graph of the top 10 words and their counts
